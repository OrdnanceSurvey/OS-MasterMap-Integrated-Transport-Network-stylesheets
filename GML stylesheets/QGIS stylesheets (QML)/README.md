# OS MasterMap Integrated Transport Network Layer

These are QML files for OS MasterMap Integrated Transport Network in GML format for use in QGIS.

*They have been designed to work with the data as it is supplied.*

## Quick start guide

**1.**  Fork or [download](https://github.com/OrdnanceSurvey/OS-MasterMap-Integrated-Transport-Network-stylesheets/archive/master.zip) the contents of this repository

**2.**  Copy the folder ‘ordnance_survey_ITN’ into your QGIS SVG directory (a typical Windows file path is C:\Program Files\QGIS xxxx\apps\qgis\svg, where xxxx represents whatever version of QGIS you are running)

**3.**  Load your Integrated Transport Network GML data into QGIS

**4.**  Double click on a layer to access the 'Layer Properties' window > click on 'Load Style...' > navigate to the directory containing the QML files (those ending .qml) > select the relevantly named QML file > click 'Open' > click 'OK'

Repeat step 4 for all layers.

We recommend the following layer order and visibility:

We recommend viewing the Integrated Transport Network data between **1:250** and **1:15,000** for maximum legibility

Your data should now look similar to this:
